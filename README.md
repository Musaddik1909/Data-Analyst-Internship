Task 1: Clean a dataset by removing missing values and outliers
Description:
Cleaning the dataset is an essential step in data analysis to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. The presence of missing values or outliers can significantly impact the accuracy of analysis results.

Handling Missing Values:

Identify columns with missing values.
Decide on an appropriate strategy for handling missing values (remove rows/columns, impute values, etc.).
Implement the chosen strategy using Pandas.

Task 2: Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) for a dataset
Description:
Summary statistics provide a concise overview of the central tendencies and dispersion of the dataset. These statistics are crucial for understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data.

Mean:

Represents the average value of a numerical column.
Calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of observations.
Median:

Represents the middle value of a numerical column.
Calculated as the value separating the higher half from the lower half of the data.
Mode:

Represents the most frequently occurring value in a column.
Standard Deviation:

Measures the extent to which data points in a numerical column deviate from the mean.

Task 3: Create a histogram or bar chart to visualize the distribution of data in a dataset
Description:
Visualizing data distribution helps in understanding patterns, trends, and the overall shape of the data. Histograms and bar charts are common tools for exploring the distribution of numerical and categorical variables, respectively.

Histogram:

Suitable for visualizing the distribution of numerical data.
Displays the frequency of values within predefined bins.
